# RecordPlayer
Emulate a record player in Sprite Kit using Swift and Xcode.

In this tutorial I will be showing you how to create your very own record player in Sprite Kit using Swift. This is a small section of an app that I am building for a band that is set to be released in a month or so. Keep an eye on the blog to keep updated with that.

When you press the play button, the disk begins to spin and our music begins playing. After, a pause button will appear that allows you to stop the disk and pause the music. Sound complicated? Don't worry, it's very simple and will teach you a whole lot about Sprite Kit and how to get the most out of Apple's wonderful frameworks.
